# UML and Design Pattern Assignment for L5 

Completed in L5 of the Digital & Technological Solutions Professional apprenticeship, Software Engineer Route at Staffordshire University 

As a means of testing your understanding of object orientated principles and good practice, you have been asked to build a prototype skills auditor application.
This application is required to identify the current skill sets of all staff for two reasons:
1.	Quickly match staff to meet a particular job/task skills requirement(s)
2.	Identify any current skills gap in order to:
    -	Identify skills and areas for development for individuals
    - Identify balance of skills within a team
    - Ensure that staff and the organisation are better able to achieve their strategic goals

The Application was then refactored to include a range of design patterns. 

This was presented to the tutor to demonstrate understanding of the following: 
*	An overview of design patterns – what are they, why do they exist, combining patterns, strengths and limitations
*	Categories of design patterns – include examples for each category (alternatives) explaining how they work
* Examples of you selecting and implementing design patterns
  -	Identify which design patterns could be implemented (and why these would be useful) – consider these in terms of usefulness and complexity.
  -	Produce class diagrams (for the patterns you are proposing to implement) to show how these patterns would be applied in context of your solution code. 
You will also submit these diagrams in a separate document.
  -	Having implemented (and tested) the proposed patterns – you will discuss the effects of the pattern on your code by comparing the original (assignment 1) code and your refactored code.
*	Critically evaluate the quality of the OO solution that you have produced and the implementation of SOLID and GRASP principles whilst avoiding relevant code smells.
